//! Here's an example of how to use some of FLAMEs APIs:
//!
//! ```
//! extern crate flame;
//!
//! use std::fs::File;
//!
//! pub fn main() {
//!     // Manual `start` and `end`
//!     flame::start("read file");
//!     let x = read_a_file();
//!     flame::end("read file");
//!
//!     // Time the execution of a closure.  (the result of the closure is returned)
//!     let y = flame::span_of("database query", || query_database());
//!
//!     // Time the execution of a block by creating a guard.
//!     let z = {
//!         let _guard = flame::start_guard("cpu-heavy calculation");
//!         cpu_heavy_operations_1();
//!         // Notes can be used to annotate a particular instant in time.
//!         flame::note("something interesting happened", None);
//!         cpu_heavy_operations_2()
//!     };
//!
//!     // Dump the report to disk
//!     flame::dump_html(&mut File::create("flame-graph.html").unwrap()).unwrap();
//!
//!     // Or read and process the data yourself!
//!     let spans = flame::spans();
//!
//!     println!("{} {} {}", x, y, z);
//! }
//!
//! # fn read_a_file() -> bool { true }
//! # fn query_database() -> bool { true }
//! # fn cpu_heavy_operations_1() {}
